[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pbuda/scalawebsocket.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pbuda/scalawebsocket)

Installation
============

ScalaWebSocket lives in Sonatype's repositories and releases are synced to Maven Central. To use snapshot versions,
simply add Sonatype snapshot repository to resolvers.

```
resolvers += "Sonatype snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"
```

#### Using SBT

```
libraryDependencies += "eu.piotrbuda" %% "scalawebsocket" % "0.1.1"
```

#### Using Maven
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>eu.piotrbuda</groupId>
  <artifactId>scalawebsocket_2.10</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Example
=======

#### Open connection and send message

```scala
    WebSocket().open("ws://echo.websocket.org/").sendText("text").close().shutdown()
```

#### Listen for text messages

```scala
    WebSocket().open("ws://echo.websocket.org/").onTextMessage(msg => doSomethingWithMessage(msg))
```

#### Add and then remove handler

To be able to remove a handler from WebSocket, it has to be a named handler.

```scala
    val handler = {
      msg: String => doSomethingWithMessage(msg)
    }
    WebSocket.open(url).onTextMessage(handler).sendText("text").removeOnTextMessage(handler)
```
